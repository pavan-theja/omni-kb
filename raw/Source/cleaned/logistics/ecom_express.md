## 0.1 V6 Refactor Notes — Manifest-Aligned Deterministic Ingestion

```yaml
v6_refactor_notes:
  refactor_basis:
  - Logistics KB Doc.docx as source-of-truth evidence
  - marketplace_cleanup_manifest_consolidated_v2.md as cleanup/review gate source
  - canonical_edge_taxonomy_registry.md as allowed edge universe
  - v4 unified-edge logistics markdowns as structural base
  refactor_goal: preserve manifest-aligned deterministic ingestion while splitting Shiprocket into role-specific logistics-partner and services-aggregator documents.
  semantic_change_policy: no unsupported tenant/group/account binding is introduced in generic logistics files.
  parser_contract:
  - candidate_card and candidate_edge blocks remain the primary ingestible units
  - review_item and manifest_gate blocks are parser governance objects, not canonical domain cards unless the ingestion pipeline explicitly supports review cards
  - candidate cards are deduped by card_id; repeated metric cards remain readability duplicates
```


## 0. Parser Instructions

This document is intended to be parsed deterministically. It is not prose-only. The parser should emit `candidate_card` blocks and `candidate_edge` blocks, normalize legacy aliases into the canonical uppercase edge taxonomy, and dedupe repeated cards by `card_id`.

Critical parser rules:

- Create only logistics-scoped reusable cards from this document.
- Do not create tenant, group, platform account, account data binding, business scope set, or business flow binding cards from generic vendor/domain documents.
- Treat scope-like fields such as `group_level_id`, `group_id`, `merchant_id`, `bank_name`, and similar values as columns/caveats only.
- Metric cards own colloquial/business meaning; metric implementation cards own platform/table-specific formulas.
- Process cards must be operational: each workflow step and state transition should identify evidence, expected state, lag/failure logic, or a review item.
- Materialize inverse edges only when `materialize_inverse: true`; otherwise use graph reverse indexes.
- Do not invent domain-specific route-binding edges. Use Business Flow Binding only in separate business-flow applicability docs.

## 1. Source Intake and Evidence Registry

## 2. Out-of-Scope Registry

```yaml
out_of_scope_item:
  id: oos.logistics.tenant_group
  topic: Tenant/group/platform account/business flow cards
  instruction: Do not create tenant, group, platform_account, account_data_binding, business_scope_set, or business_flow_binding
    cards from generic logistics files. Use business flow applicability docs for that layer.
  allowed_as: source column, caveat, review item, or business-flow applicability input only
```
```yaml
out_of_scope_item:
  id: oos.logistics.account_filters
  topic: Account filters and group_level_id values
  instruction: Treat group_level_id, merchant_id, bank_name, and similar scope fields as source columns or caveats only unless

```
```yaml
out_of_scope_item:
  id: oos.logistics.bank_statement_execution
  topic: Bank statement execution
  instruction: Generic logistics docs can expose UTR and bank-reference bridge fields, but actual bank account selection and

```
```yaml
out_of_scope_item:

    where documented.
  allowed_as: source column, caveat, review item, or business-flow applicability input only
```

## 3. Compact Semantic Field Contract

| card family | required semantic intent |
|---|---|
| `platform/platform_context` | platform identity, region/context, platform_type, source codes, evidence refs |
| `table/column/value_profile` | grain, amount semantics, join/filter roles, coverage status, known values, caveats |
| `relationship` | source/target table, join keys, cardinality, safe usage, aggregation risk |
| `metric/metric_implementation` | colloquial metric meaning vs vendor/table formula, metric_pattern, required columns, filters, allowed grains |
| `business_process/workflow_step/state_transition/process_variant` | lifecycle, evidence-bearing checkpoint, from/to state, lag/failure logic, operating-model variant |
| `reconciliation cards` | profile, expected/actual sides, unit, matching logic, mismatch category, variants |
| `execution guidance` | query pattern, rule, validation test, output contract, constraint set |


## Manifest Layer A — Evidence Anchor Manifests

These anchors convert broad source references into exact source sections. A deterministic parser should resolve every `candidate_card.fields.evidence_refs` entry to one or more of these anchor IDs using the resolution rules below. Do not infer semantics outside the `supported_semantics` list.

  finding: Query patterns are card/edge complete, but some query_pattern cards use pseudo-SQL shape rather than a concrete sql_ref block. This is acceptable for KB ingestion but should be completed before runtime SQL generation.
  deterministic_action: Keep cards active for retrieval; mark SQL generation as requiring orchestrator completion or downstream SQL-pattern registry.

  applies_to:
  - reconciliation_profile.courier_batch_to_bank_credit
  - table.zs_observe.bank_statement
  finding: Bank statement table semantics are represented only as a placeholder in logistics reconciliation patterns. Actual bank account selection and bank table semantics must be supplied by Banking KB and Business Flow Binding.
  deterministic_action: Use bank_statement placeholder for graph traversal only; do not treat it as the final bank source schema.
